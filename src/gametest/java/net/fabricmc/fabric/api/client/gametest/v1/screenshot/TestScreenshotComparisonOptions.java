/**
 * Options for comparing screenshots.
 *
 * <p>
 * By default, screenshots are compared with a fuzzy comparison which allows
 * screenshots to be 0.5% different from
 * the template image. See
 * {@link TestScreenshotComparisonAlgorithm#defaultAlgorithm()} for details on
 * how this is
 * implemented. To change the threshold for how different the screenshot can be,
 * set the algorithm to
 * {@link TestScreenshotComparisonAlgorithm#meanSquaredDifference(float)}. To
 * force the screenshot to be exactly the
 * same as your template, use {@link TestScreenshotComparisonAlgorithm#exact()}.
 * It is recommended to stick with fuzzy
 * matching unless you specifically require an exact match, because the exact
 * screenshot can vary slightly on different
 * frames and in rare cases other factors such as the GPU/driver version.
 *
 * <p>
 * Template images must be fully opaque, this API will throw if the template
 * image has any transparent pixels.
 *
 * <p>
 * Template images loaded from a path are expected to be in the
 * {@code templates} directory inside the resources
 * directory of the mod which registered the gametest. If the template image is
 * not found then the screenshot will be
 * saved to the {@code templates} directory so that it can be used next time the
 * gametest is run. Your test mod's
 * resources directory is in the
 * {@code fabric.client.gametest.testModResourcesPath} system property which is
 * set by
 * Loom by default. You may set this system property to override the location of
 * the test mod resources directory. If
 * this system property is unset and the template image is not found, then the
 * test will fail.
